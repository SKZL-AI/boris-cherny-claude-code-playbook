### #03.12 — Encode Domain Knowledge as Agent-Ready Artifacts

- **Source:** [X-Thread](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2077460395279692197)
- **Author:** @bcherny
- **Quote:** "automate, and encode domain knowledge as infrastructure"

Every team should write CLAUDE.md files, REVIEW.md review guides, skills, and inline docs so agents can work in the codebase with zero additional context from the prompter. Previously, automation was limited to what lint rules, types, and tests could express; CLAUDE.md-based infrastructure can now capture nearly all domain knowledge — architecture patterns, review criteria, team conventions, and more. This is the AI-era equivalent of the automation investments that made the best engineers 10x.

Dynamic Workflows orchestrate dozens to hundreds of subagents from a JavaScript script Claude writes automatically for your task. Include the word `workflow` anywhere in a prompt to trigger one, or activate `/effort ultracode` to have Claude plan workflows automatically for every task in the session. Best suited for codebase-wide audits, 500-file migrations, framework swaps, and API deprecations that would otherwise occupy a team for a quarter.

Boris outlines four steps of team AI adoption and warns that token consumption is a proxy for activity, not return. The right question: would this task have required engineering effort without AI, and if so, how many hours would it have cost? That delta — engineering hours saved — is the true ROI; the biggest payoff comes as Claude handles background maintenance and bug-fixing autonomously.
